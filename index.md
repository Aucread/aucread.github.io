Hi, I'm Piotrek!

![Alt text](/assets/Portait2024.png){:width="300px"}

I'm a lifelong learner and problem solver. 
In 2022 I finished PhD in Physics studying magnetic resonance (NMR) without magnets.
Currently I am a postdoc at [Harvard University](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/) investigating many-body dynamics of quasi-atomic defects in diamond.
And I am still doing weird [NMR](https://hongkunparklab.com/)  - this time in nanoscale.

I am an avid reader (mostly non-fiction), nature and [cat](https://www.instagram.com/bubu_and_niunia/) enjoyer. 
On this simple website you will find some basic information about me.
