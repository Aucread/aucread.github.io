Hi, I'm Piotrek!
![Alt text](/assets/Portait2024.png){:width="30px"}


I'm a lifelong learner and problem solver. 
In 2022 I finished my PhD in Physics studying magnetic resonance (NMR) without magnets.
Currently I am a postdoc at Harvard University investigating many-body dynamics of quasi-atomic defects in diamond.
And I am still doing weird NMR - this time in nanoscale.

I am an avid reader (mostly non-fiction), nature and cat enjoyer. 
On this simple website you will find some simple information about me.
